[00:00.93] Outside my window is a tree
[00:07.18] Outside my window is a tree
[00:16.55] There only for me
[00:21.65] And it stands in the grey of the city
[00:27.07] No time for pity, for the tree or me
[00:45.07] 
[00:32.82] There is a world of pain
[00:41.61] In the falling rain
[00:46.21] Around me
[00:50.71] 
[00:49.54] Is there a reason for today?
[00:55.86] Is there a reason for today?
[01:05.22] Do you remember?
[01:09.12] I can hear all the cries of the city
[01:15.03] No time for pity for a growing tree
[01:32.53] 
[01:21.51] There is a world of pain
[01:29.87] In the falling rain
[01:34.22] Around me
[01:38.72] 
[01:37.53] Outside my window is a tree
[02:04.33] Outside my window is a tree
[02:10.48] There only for me
[02:15.65] And it stands in the grey of the city
[02:20.39] No time for pity for the tree or me
[02:37.89] 
[02:28.74] There is a world of pain
[02:34.69] In the falling rain
[02:38.97] Around me
