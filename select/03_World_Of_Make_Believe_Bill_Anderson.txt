(Pee Wee Maddux - Mario Carpenter - Pete McCord)

I make believe, I make believe
That you're here with me, yes I do
I make believe, I make believe
That you'll always be my very own, yes I do.
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe.

I make believe. I make believe
Every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you. yes I do baby.
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe.

And yet faith can move mountains
And behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
(If you'll make believe) if you'll just make believe
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true.
And we'll both live in a world of make believe.

And we'll both live in a world of make believe...
