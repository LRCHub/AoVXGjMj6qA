I really don't care about world affairs
I keep myself in line
I really don't care about politics
It's just a waste of time

I'm not as dumb as you think I am
I might know a thing or two
I really don't care about nothing at all
But I thought the world of you

I really don't care about world peace
I try not to be a jerk
I really don't care about the meaning of life
Or my place in the universe

I'm not as dumb as you think I am
I might know a thing or two
I really don't care about nothing at all
But I thought the world of you

I'm not phobic, phillic, sick or blind
People wanna judge me
They exercise their open minds
Call me names and make fun of me

I'm not as dumb as you think I am
I might know a thing or two
I really don't care about nothing at all
But I thought the world of you
I really don't care about nothing at all, but I thought the world of you
I really don't care about nothing at all, but I thought the world of you
