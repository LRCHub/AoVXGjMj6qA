I'm thinking
Faces changing pictures come to mind
Try to change the subject

Sensation
Stare reveal me, still i want to know
Capture time in a photograph

Well i say "how do you do"
Shatters my mirrored view
If only your lie would disappear
Why don't you plaster your face
Then i just might believe
I'll crack you open, smash you down

I repeat
Your mad charade
This s. r. game you play's a freeze
Indifference
Greetings and smiles
You've got yours now i've got... mine

I've got to swallow your pride
Shallow men hear no rhyme
Furniture shifts as you walk by
Why don't you look in my eyes
What do you see in there
Plastic melts in a world of smiles

I'm laughing
Hurt me, hurt me, now the joke's on you
Satisfy your conscience

Stop talking, stop talking
Tear me open and leave me here to bleed
Cut me up, cut me down to size
