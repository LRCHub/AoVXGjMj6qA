There's a world of difference
Between our visions and our hearts
Sweeping clouds, stares the moon
When do we recognize?
Milling crowds talking proud
Oh we all so wise

In a world of difference
Where sound decisions tear us apart
Is love derision? Or is it a mission?
In a changing world

Sweeping clouds, stares the moon
When do we recognize?
Milling crowds talking loud
Oh we all so wise

In a world of difference
Where differences dance, keep us apart
Give us equal treasure and all its pleasures
In a changing world
