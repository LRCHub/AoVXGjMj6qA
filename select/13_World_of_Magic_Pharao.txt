In the land of love
Take me to the world of magic

Take me
Take me to the world of magic
Show me where my dreams come true
Take me
Take me to the world of magic
A place to live for me and you
Take me
Take me to the world of magic
Tell me where you wanna be
Take me
Take me to the world of magic
The one and only place to be

There's a place
I know
I take you to
That you feel the wind of gold
A light
Silver breeze
A deep
The blue trees
A peaceful world that no one else knows
Land of love
City of sound
Music coming round
The mountain
Fountain full of treasure
Like fiction
If you see you won't be down
The minute that you touch the ground
The rhythm and sound of the love and joy is bound
Or just change your life around
And if you're down
Cool
We'll go together me and you
Only the choosen one's will fly

To the land of love
Take me to the world of magic
Show me where my dreams come true
Take me
Take me to the world of magic
A place to live for me and you
Take me
Take me to the world of magic
Tell me where you wanna be
Take me
Take me to the world of magic
The one and only place to be

If you see
Make believe
Stay true
Travel amazed
Find a way through to a wonderful land
Where no living man has gone
But in the end it's the peace and love
That will shine on from above
Come to a land where unity exists
A magical world you can't miss
