We're living in harmony
In a world of freedom
We are one big family
In a world of freedom
Let's forget what we have before
In a world of freedom
We know what we're living for
In a world of freedom
In a world

All the people in the world
Want to live together
They love their family and their home,
In good and stormy weather
We're all living in one world,
So let's keep protect it
What we're building up so long,
Take my hand and sing this song

We've got to stay together
To keep our world a lovely place
So we're trying harder
To make it better everyday
We don't have another world
It's our favorite planet
Take my words you can be sure
It's a life we're living till we fall

In a world of freedom
In peace and harmony
In a world of freedom
In peace and harmony

Freedeom, harmony, freedom
Keep protect it
Freedeom, harmony, freedom
Da da da da dey
Freedeom, harmony, freedom
Keep protect it
Freedeom, harmony, freedom
